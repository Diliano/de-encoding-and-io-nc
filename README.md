# Encoding and IO

<br>
In this sprint you will interact with each data set and complete tasks.

The instructions for each can be found in the tasks folder.

You will need to create a file, in the root of your repo, for each data set to work in and print the results of each task to the terminal.

Notes for this sprint can be found here: [Encoding and IO notes](https://notes.northcoders.com/courses/de-python-fundamentals/file-io)
